# Power BI Journey

This repository tracks my self-taught journey into Power BIâ€”one project, one insight at a time.

It includes:
- `.pbix` files for dashboards and reports
- Raw and cleaned datasets
- Notes on learning paths, approach, and reflections
- Practice material for certifications, including Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate

No fancy classes. No expensive bootcamps. Just grit, curiosity, and relentless consistency.
